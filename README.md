# Making and Tinkering Project: Vitality Meter

This Github repository contains our implementation for Vitality Meter.

Vitality Meter is a Making and Tinkering project undertaken by Neo Wei Ming and Deemithra Chamikara Wijesooriya from Nanyang Technological University. It is a device that is capable of measuring glucose concentration in biofluids such as blood, sweat and tears. It also includes an oximeter and heart rate sensor. This allows users to measure 3 vital signs - glucose concentration, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. 

Measurements are made using a printed circuit board which are then transferred to an Android application via Bluetooth Low Energy.
