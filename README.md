# Vitality Meter

This repository contains all the code for Vitality Meter.

Vitality Meter is a project undertaken by Neo Wei Ming and Deemithra Chamikara Wijesooriya from Nanyang Technological University. It is a device that is capable of measuring glucose concentration in biofluids such as blood, sweat and tears. It also includes an oximeter and heart rate sensor. This allows users to measure 3 vital signs - glucose concentration, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. 

Measurements are made using a printed circuit board which are then transferred to an Android application via Bluetooth Low Energy. 

The full project details can be found in the blog https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ps9888-2021-g16/design-specifications/
